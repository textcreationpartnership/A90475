            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Which was by the Lord <hi>Taaff</hi> applyed to himÅ¿elf, for that the hill whereon he Å¿tood was called <hi>Knockno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> and his AnceÅ¿tors had the lands of <hi>Mack. Donagh</hi> given by the Kings of Enland in reward of their Å¿ervice performed againÅ¿t he Rebells here, their Leuiftenant Generall Sr. <hi>Alexander Mac Donnell</hi> known vulgarly by the name of <hi>Colkitta,</hi> was unwilling to have the fight performed on that day (upon a Å¿uperÅ¿tious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervation,; for that he was exceedingly afraid of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns</hi> malevolent influence, that day being to him criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call) the former name of this place was antiquated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t this laÅ¿t age, the name of it now being EngliÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans hill, as it proved upon this happy and Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿efull day.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Taaff</hi> therefore reÅ¿olving obÅ¿tinately to adhere to his choÅ¿en ground, the Lord PreÅ¿ident calling a CounÅ¿ell of War to adviÅ¿e whether it were expedient to aÅ¿Å¿ault them on Å¿uch a diÅ¿advantageous place (the wind freinding them likewiÅ¿e, and their numbers almoÅ¿t doubling ours) but the Å¿ence of our preÅ¿ent condition quickly reÅ¿olved this Å¿cruple, it being to no purpoÅ¿e to have advanced hitherto, if wee Å¿hould proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and for the Å¿ucceÅ¿s to put our Å¿elves upon the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God. It is not to be forgotten here that before the CounÅ¿ell, the Lord PreÅ¿ident commanded that God Å¿hould be Å¿ought by prayer, for our direction in this needful time of trouble. The word given on our Å¿ide was Victory, the mark a branch of new broome in our hats, wherewith our Quarters then abounded. The
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:161335:5"/>enemies mark was a Å¿trawen rope about their hats; their Word was God and St. <hi>Paterick,</hi> they having forgotten how lately their contry St. had failed them; (for that was the word when we put them to the Å¿word at <hi>CaÅ¿hel</hi>) their numbers conÅ¿iÅ¿ted as themÅ¿elves gave out 9000. Foote. and a 1000. HorÅ¿e, but by liÅ¿t found afterwardes in the Leiuftenant Generals pocket, they were muÅ¿tred in the field 7464 foot, and 1076, horÅ¿e. beÅ¿ides Officers: our Army was neere 4000 Foote, and 1200 horÅ¿e, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie ranging their battell in a plain front, all along the hill, that Å¿o they might ingage all their force together, their foot were drawn into nine diviÅ¿ions, of which the greater part by much was Pike, wing'd with three bodies of HorÅ¿e on each Å¿ide, beÅ¿ide reÅ¿erves; our foot whoÅ¿e number was by half the leÅ¿Å¿e, were marÅ¿hald in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three deviÅ¿ions, whereof two parts of three were Muskets, the right and left Wing of <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> were made of 13 bodies of <hi>HorÅ¿e,</hi> 7 on the right wing, and 6 on the left (with their <hi>ReÅ¿erves;</hi>) Both <hi>Armies</hi> thus drawn up,</p>
            <p>The Rebels held firmly (their firÅ¿t reÅ¿olution) not to parte with their Å¿tation, but that we Å¿hould either not fight at all, or do it upon theÅ¿e unequall tearms, the wind was for the Rebells, the Lord PreÅ¿ident (whoÅ¿e Rivall no man can be in this piece of glory, it being indeed in all mens judgements, under God, the gaining of the day on our Å¿ide) throughly weighing their numbred ground and Comodity of the place, above us, all which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idered of too much moment they might be to turn the Seale in the Ballance of War, thought of a way of forcing them to that which they would not willingly be drawn to, to leave the ground, and diÅ¿compoÅ¿e their preÅ¿ent forme, that Å¿o (we might have the advantage in that diÅ¿order) to aÅ¿Å¿ault them; and this he effected thus;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:161335:5"/>
He drew the left wing of his battle from the ground, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he at firÅ¿t placed them, making them move into a place of fallow ground more leftward, as if he would get upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies backs on that Å¿ide, and Commanded his right wing to wave a little that way too, as if he went with all his Force to aÅ¿Å¿ail them in that one place. The Rebels carefull enough to Å¿upport their own deÅ¿igne, had a watchfull eye upon all our motions; and by this laÅ¿t, imagining they might be charged in the Rear, or Å¿urcharged with the multitudes of our men at one place, the train of the Lord PreÅ¿idents Plot immediately took; for they breaking their firÅ¿t form, parted with their Å¿tands: LikewiÅ¿e drawing moÅ¿t of their Forces to Å¿uccour their right wing, by varying the Å¿cene of their ground, we got theÅ¿e ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. The wind was made an indifferent arbiter, the aÅ¿cent of the hill not Å¿o Å¿teep, and onely the Sunne was now a neuter to ripen the Fruit of this DeÅ¿ign quite, which was now more then green. The Lord PreÅ¿ident commanded two pieces of Artillery to be drawn to play on their right wing, and if any diÅ¿order thereby hapned, our HorÅ¿e and Foot were in that nick to fall on: our right wing having obÅ¿erved the left of theirs, made thin with Å¿ome confuÅ¿ion likewiÅ¿e in Å¿ending re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to their friends, had command to reÅ¿ume their firÅ¿t Å¿tations, and to incline further to the right hand (as our left wing had done before to the left) as if they likewiÅ¿e intended to Å¿urpriÅ¿e the Rebels on the back; to prevent which, the Rebels reÅ¿olved immediatdly to fall on: to this end they advanced with their HorÅ¿e before their Foot, to charge; but that errour being Å¿oon eÅ¿pied by ours, our Å¿hot were commanded preÅ¿ently to advance under the Å¿helter of a Ditch that parted them and us, who pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Å¿uch Å¿howers of hail upon them (that it proving a funerall peall to many) the reÅ¿t retired foul, and routed their own Foot. This their neighbours eÅ¿pying, followed their example, and Å¿o their main body of Foot, and left wing of HorÅ¿e ran clean
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:161335:6"/>way, and our HorÅ¿e followed after them in the chaÅ¿e: But God willing to mingle a little gall with the Å¿weet cup he had before given us (that Å¿o we might be contented to receive every thing at his hand) was pleaÅ¿ed, that part of ground which was aÅ¿Å¿igned for our left wing, was not Å¿o convenient for horÅ¿e, yet to be accepted (where there was no choice of better) but very defenceable by Foote, by reaÅ¿on of Å¿ome incloÅ¿ures and ditches, and a lane near adjacent; there the Lord PreÅ¿ident made the bounds of his Foot, but they by their vallour (if not raÅ¿hneÅ¿Å¿e rather) fancying to themÅ¿elves Å¿ome imaginary advantage, preÅ¿t further, and Å¿o clouded us a little with the Å¿moake of their Å¿hot, that the right wing of the <hi>Rebels</hi> Army which was led by Sir <hi>Alexander Mack-Donnel,</hi> alias <hi>Colkitto.</hi> the <hi>Rebels</hi> Lieutenant generall, on whom our guns playing fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercely (to prevent that danger and performe Å¿ome notable Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as he had promiÅ¿ed with his Red-Å¿hankes) came thundring downe without the leaÅ¿t Å¿ence of danger, even the <hi>Rebels</hi> horÅ¿e on their right winge advancing with thoÅ¿e foot, were charged by their oppoÅ¿ite horÅ¿e on our left wing, and routed; who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing hard upon them, the <hi>Rebels</hi> foot Å¿lipt in undecerned of them upon our foot, whoÅ¿e forwardneÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿eeing the enemies horÅ¿e routed had left their defenÅ¿ive Å¿tage which they might with eaÅ¿e and Å¿afely have maintained; and rouling downe like a Torrent impetuouÅ¿ly on our foot, routed our forlorne hope, by which meanes our foot being our numbred the Enemy began to have the execution of them; poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿t two of our guns, and one of them being loaded, diÅ¿charged it againÅ¿t us, and Å¿o tearing down all before them got to our waggons and there fel a plundering had it not bin for this diÅ¿aÅ¿ter, without doubt, we had bought a moÅ¿t perfect &amp; glorious victory at the eaÅ¿ieÅ¿t rate that might be without the loÅ¿Å¿e as is imagined of ten men, but this coÅ¿t Å¿ome fifty of our common men their lives, and divers of out galanteÅ¿t Commanders not being able to Å¿tay their men
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:161335:6"/>nor willing to run along with them, there gloriouÅ¿ly Å¿acrificed their lives, rather chuÅ¿ing to die, though almoÅ¿t deÅ¿erted of all, then to give the leaÅ¿t ground back to Å¿o barbarous and cruell Rebels. The Lord PreÅ¿ident was but newly parted from the left wing being on the right, where he ioyfully Å¿aw a Victory on the nick of gaining, by the totall diÅ¿comfiture of that part of the Enemy: but looking towards our left wing, there his eyes were preÅ¿ented with the rufull Å¿pectacle of his mens Å¿laughters and the Rebels overturning all before them even to our wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, he immediately poÅ¿ted down Å¿om Regiments of Foot, and a troop or two of HorÅ¿e, which had been there for ReÅ¿erves, and not come upon the charge: TheÅ¿e coming down fell upon the Rebels in their return from our Baggage, where they made there lives, pay the price of their inÅ¿olent attempt by putting the greateÅ¿t part of them to the, Å¿word, amongÅ¿t whom fell Sir <hi>Alexander Mack Donnell</hi> and his Lievtenant Colonel. And thus by Gods help and the wiÅ¿dome and vallour of our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, Commanders and Souldiers, a glorious victory was gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the Rebels, the chaÅ¿e was followed every way by our Foot and HorÅ¿e, but HorÅ¿e eÅ¿pecially, for they were too light for our footmen, all over the Countrey, till night hindred the further proÅ¿ecution when a retreat being Å¿ounded for that time the Lord PreÅ¿ident and his Officers in the field with their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, gave thanks to God for his extraordinary great mercy, and deliverance. The Å¿laughter was not made an end with that day, for the next day our HorÅ¿e ranged the Countrey and found divers; and the foot hunted the woods, and bogs, and by that means found many of the enemy which were put to the Å¿word upon the place.</p>
            <p>The Å¿torm fell Å¿ore upon their foot, the Country who Å¿hould know beÅ¿t report five thouÅ¿and to be Å¿laine, there could not be leÅ¿Å¿e then foure thouÅ¿and, we recovered neer 6000 Armes, 38 Collours of Foote, with Å¿ome Cornets of HorÅ¿e, wee alÅ¿o re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
